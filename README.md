# Aurelia :heart: IdentityServer

### An application demonstrating how to use Aurelia in conjunction with IdentityServer4.


There are three projects in this repository

* Aurelia.IdentityServer: Plays as an Identity Provider
    * `npm run start:idsrv`

* Aurelia.WebApi: A RESTful api in .Net Core with a secure api
    * `npm run start:webapi`

* Aurelia.Client: An Aurelia application that wants to access the secured apis
    * `npm run start:aurelia` 


**PS:** You can open the solution in `Visual Studio` and hit `F5`, or open the workspace in `VS Code`
